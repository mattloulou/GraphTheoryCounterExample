## What is this project?
During my first year of university (Matthew Pechen-Berg), I learned about this conjecture during an honours algebra course from my professor which stuck with me.
It originated from the Danish mathematician C. Thomassen: "For all 3-vertex-connected graphs, every longest cycle must have a chord".

I initially tried many approaches to prove this conjecture as true across many months. I lost lots of sleep about it because I kept coming up with ideas while trying to go to bed. However, all my attempts failed.
My friend, whom I told about this project, decided with me to try and look for a counter example, as only 1 valid counter-example would conclude that life this half-century long conjecture.


This is not as easy as it sounds, as there is no polynomial-time algorithm for finding largest cycles in a simple graph.

We ultimately did not find a conjecture, but we are happy with our try nonetheless.
